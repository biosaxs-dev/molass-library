abstract = {The {\it ATSAS} software suite encompasses a number of programs for the processing, visualization, analysis and modelling of small-angle scattering data, with a focus on the data measured from biological macromolecules. Here, new developments in the {\it ATSAS 3.0} package are described. They include {\it IMSIM}, for simulating isotropic 2D scattering patterns; {\it IMOP}, to perform operations on 2D images and masks; {\it DATRESAMPLE}, a method for variance estimation of structural invariants through parametric resampling; {\it DATFT}, which computes the pair distance distribution function by a direct Fourier transform of the scattering data; {\it PDDFFIT}, to compute the scattering data from a pair distance distribution function, allowing comparison with the experimental data; a new module in {\it DATMW} for Bayesian consensus-based concentration-independent molecular weight estimation; {\it DATMIF}, an {\it ab initio} shape analysis method that optimizes the search model directly against the scattering data; {\it DAMEMB}, an application to set up the initial search volume for multiphase modelling of membrane proteins; {\it ELLLIP}, to perform quasi-atomistic modelling of liposomes with elliptical shapes; {\it NMATOR}, which models conformational changes in nucleic acid structures through normal mode analysis in torsion angle space; {\it DAMMIX}, which reconstructs the shape of an unknown intermediate in an evolving system; and {\it LIPMIX} and {\it BILMIX}, for modelling multilamellar and asymmetric lipid vesicles, respectively. In addition, technical updates were deployed to facilitate maintainability of the package, which include porting the {\it PRIMUS} graphical interface to Qt5, updating {\it SASpy} {--} a {\it PyMOL} plugin to run a subset of {\it ATSAS} tools {--} to be both Python 2 and 3 compatible, and adding utilities to facilitate mmCIF compatibility in future {\it ATSAS} releases. All these features are implemented in {\it ATSAS 3.0}, freely available for academic users at https://www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/software.html.},

abstract = {{\it BioXTAS RAW} is a free open-source program for reduction, analysis and modelling of biological small-angle scattering data. Here, the new developments in {\it RAW} version 2 are described. These include improved data reduction using {\it pyFAI}; updated automated Guinier fitting and {\it D}${\sb max}$ finding algorithms; automated series ({\it e.g.} size-exclusion chromatography coupled small-angle X-ray scattering or SEC-SAXS) buffer- and sample-region finding algorithms; linear and integral baseline correction for series; deconvolution of series data using regularized alternating least squares ({\it REGALS}); creation of electron-density reconstructions using electron density via solution scattering ({\it DENSS}); a comparison window showing residuals, ratios and statistical comparisons between profiles; and generation of PDF reports with summary plots and tables for all analysis. Furthermore, there is now a {\it RAW} API, which can be used without the graphical user interface (GUI), providing full access to all of the functionality found in the GUI. In addition to these new capabilities, {\it RAW} has undergone significant technical updates, such as adding Python 3 compatibility, and has entirely new documentation available both online and in the program.},
