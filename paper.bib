    abstract = {The scattering intensities measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiment are generally recorded as a two-dimensional image data these days. The intensities are converted into a one-dimensional data by azimuthal average for the structural analysis. We developed the GUI software, SAngler for data analysis with mainly the PILATUS data. SAngler was developed by Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows and the program language of C#, and runs on Windows 7 and 8.1 64bit. It can perform the several basic analysis for SAXS data after the conversion from 2D image and 1D data.},

abstract = {The {\it ATSAS} software suite encompasses a number of programs for the processing, visualization, analysis and modelling of small-angle scattering data, with a focus on the data measured from biological macromolecules. Here, new developments in the {\it ATSAS 3.0} package are described. They include {\it IMSIM}, for simulating isotropic 2D scattering patterns; {\it IMOP}, to perform operations on 2D images and masks; {\it DATRESAMPLE}, a method for variance estimation of structural invariants through parametric resampling; {\it DATFT}, which computes the pair distance distribution function by a direct Fourier transform of the scattering data; {\it PDDFFIT}, to compute the scattering data from a pair distance distribution function, allowing comparison with the experimental data; a new module in {\it DATMW} for Bayesian consensus-based concentration-independent molecular weight estimation; {\it DATMIF}, an {\it ab initio} shape analysis method that optimizes the search model directly against the scattering data; {\it DAMEMB}, an application to set up the initial search volume for multiphase modelling of membrane proteins; {\it ELLLIP}, to perform quasi-atomistic modelling of liposomes with elliptical shapes; {\it NMATOR}, which models conformational changes in nucleic acid structures through normal mode analysis in torsion angle space; {\it DAMMIX}, which reconstructs the shape of an unknown intermediate in an evolving system; and {\it LIPMIX} and {\it BILMIX}, for modelling multilamellar and asymmetric lipid vesicles, respectively. In addition, technical updates were deployed to facilitate maintainability of the package, which include porting the {\it PRIMUS} graphical interface to Qt5, updating {\it SASpy} {--} a {\it PyMOL} plugin to run a subset of {\it ATSAS} tools {--} to be both Python 2 and 3 compatible, and adding utilities to facilitate mmCIF compatibility in future {\it ATSAS} releases. All these features are implemented in {\it ATSAS 3.0}, freely available for academic users at https://www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/software.html.},

abstract = {{\it BioXTAS RAW} is a free open-source program for reduction, analysis and modelling of biological small-angle scattering data. Here, the new developments in {\it RAW} version 2 are described. These include improved data reduction using {\it pyFAI}; updated automated Guinier fitting and {\it D}${\sb max}$ finding algorithms; automated series ({\it e.g.} size-exclusion chromatography coupled small-angle X-ray scattering or SEC-SAXS) buffer- and sample-region finding algorithms; linear and integral baseline correction for series; deconvolution of series data using regularized alternating least squares ({\it REGALS}); creation of electron-density reconstructions using electron density via solution scattering ({\it DENSS}); a comparison window showing residuals, ratios and statistical comparisons between profiles; and generation of PDF reports with summary plots and tables for all analysis. Furthermore, there is now a {\it RAW} API, which can be used without the graphical user interface (GUI), providing full access to all of the functionality found in the GUI. In addition to these new capabilities, {\it RAW} has undergone significant technical updates, such as adding Python 3 compatibility, and has entirely new documentation available both online and in the program.},
