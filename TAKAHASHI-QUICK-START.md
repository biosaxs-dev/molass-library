# 🛠️ TAKAHASHI'S QUICK START GUIDE

**Your guide to supporting JOSS review responses with Copilot**

---

## 📱 **Before You Start: One-Time Setup**

### **Already Done! ✅**
- Username path configured in `COPILOT-INIT.md`
- Using Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Repository structure ready
- GitHub Actions bot deployed

### **Important: Use Agent Mode**
In VS Code Copilot Chat:
- Click the mode selector (top of chat)
- Choose **"Agent"** (not "Ask Copilot")
- Agent mode lets Copilot work autonomously for you

**You're all set!**

---

## 💬 **Every Time You Work: The 3-Step Loop**

### **STEP 1: Start Copilot Agent**
1. Open VS Code
2. **Make sure Agent mode is selected** (check mode selector at top of chat)
3. Say:
```
Please read COPILOT-INIT.md to initialize
```
Copilot Agent will recognize you as Takahashi and autonomously load the right context.

### **STEP 2: Tell Agent Your Goal**
Simply state what you want to accomplish:
- "I need to provide technical info for the Python version question"
- "Help me review Shimizu's draft about baseline methodology"
- "What's my current status?"

Agent will automatically check status, read relevant files, and gather context.

### **STEP 3: Review Agent's Work**
Agent will autonomously create/edit files and manage markers. You should:
- Check the files Agent created/edited
- Verify technical accuracy
- Ask for changes if needed
- Approve when satisfied

## 🔄 **Your Support Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Wait for Review to Start**
✅ Nothing to do yet—system is ready!

### **Phase 2: When Shimizu Captures Comments**
✅ No action needed—Shimizu handles this phase.

### **Phase 3: When Shimizu Needs Technical Input**

**What triggers this:**
- Shimizu adds `NEEDS-TECH-INPUT` marker to a reviewer comment file
- Bot automatically creates a GitHub issue tagged with `tech-input-needed` and `takahashi`

**What you do:**
1. **Check GitHub Issues** (you'll get notified)
2. **Read the reviewer comment** (link in the issue)
3. **Say to Copilot Agent:**

```
Help me provide technical info for [issue topic]
```

4. **Copilot Agent will autonomously:**
   - Create a file in `review-discussions/tech-info/`
   - Format your technical explanation
   - Remove `NEEDS-TECH-INPUT` marker from comment file
5. **Review Agent's work** and approve
6. **Close** the GitHub issue manually

**What happens next:**
- Shimizu uses your info to draft a response

### **Phase 4: When Shimizu's Draft Needs Review**

**What triggers this:**
- Shimizu adds `READY-FOR-TECH-REVIEW` marker to a draft file
- Bot automatically creates a GitHub issue tagged with `tech-review-needed` and `takahashi`

**What you do:**
1. **Check GitHub Issues** (you'll get notified)
2. **Read the draft response** (link in the issue)
3. **Review for technical accuracy**:
   - ✅ Are the technical details correct?
   - ✅ Are promises feasible to implement?
   - ✅ Is the tone professional?
4. **Provide feedback**:
   - Add comments directly in the draft file
   - Or create a review file in `review-discussions/tech-info/`
5. **If approved**, say to Copilot Agent:

```
This draft is approved and ready to post
```

6. **Copilot Agent will autonomously:**
   - Remove `READY-FOR-TECH-REVIEW` marker
   - Update draft status
7. **Close** the GitHub issue manually

**What happens next:**
- Shimizu posts the approved response to JOSS

### **Phase 5: After Response is Posted**

**What triggers this:**
- Shimizu posts response to JOSS
- Response archived in `posted-responses/`

**What you might need to do:**
- Implement code changes mentioned in the response
- Update documentation
- Create examples or tests
- Commit and push changes to molass-library

```
Copilot, help me explain [technical concept] in simple terms for Shimizu
```

### **Situation 3: Reviewing Shimizu's Draft**
👉 Say:
```
Copilot, help me review this draft for technical accuracy
```

### **Situation 4: Need to Implement Code Changes**
👉 Say:
```
Based on our response, I need to implement [describe change]
```

### **Situation 5: I'm Not Sure About Something**
👉 Say:
```
I need clarification on [topic]. What does Shimizu need from me?
```

## 📂 **The Files You'll Use**

### **Files You NEED to Know:**
1. **`CURRENT-STATUS.md`** ← Always check this first
2. **`reviewer-comments/`** ← Read these to understand issues
3. **`tech-info/`** ← Create your technical explanations here
4. **`response-drafts/`** ← Review Shimizu's drafts here
5. **GitHub Issues** ← Your notification system

### **Files You Can IGNORE:**
- `posted-responses/` (archives only, Shimizu manages)
- Most coordination docs (unless specific question)

---

## 💡 **Simple Rules to Remember**

### ✅ **DO:**
- Always initialize Copilot first (read COPILOT-INIT.md)
- Check GitHub Issues regularly for notifications
- Provide clear, simple technical explanations
- Be honest if something is not feasible
- Close issues after completing your part
- Update `CURRENT-STATUS.md` when you finish work

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Post directly to JOSS (that's Shimizu's role)
- Skip reviewing drafts (your technical expertise is crucial)
- Make promises in responses you can't keep
- Forget to remove markers after completing tasks
- Leave GitHub issues open indefinitely

---

## 🎪 **Two Repositories = Two Purposes**

### **Private Repository (molass-review)** ← You're here now
- Coordinate with Shimizu
- Draft responses together
- Provide technical information
- **NEVER POST THESE TO JOSS!**

### **Public Repository (molass-library)** ← The actual code
- Implement code changes
- Update documentation
- Fix bugs mentioned in review
- This is what reviewers are evaluating

---

## 🤝 **Your Role as Technical Support**

You are the **technical expert supporting Shimizu's responses**.

**You provide**:
- Technical information when Shimizu asks
- Code implementation details
- Feasibility assessments
- Technical accuracy review
- Actual code/doc changes

**You DON'T**:
- Draft most responses (Shimizu does this)
- Post to JOSS (Shimizu does this)
- Make final decisions on response strategy (Shimizu leads)

**Why this approach?**
- Shimizu understands scientific context better
- You focus on what you're best at (code & technical details)
- Unified voice from Shimizu (clearer for reviewers)
- Division of labor = more efficient

---

## 📞 **Getting Help**

### **From Copilot:**
Just ask! Say things like:
- "What technical info does Shimizu need?"
- "Help me review this draft"
- "How should I explain [technical concept]?"

### **From Shimizu:**
- He'll ask questions in the GitHub issues
- Or add comments in the reviewer comment files
- Bot notifications will alert you

### **Emergency:**
If something breaks, just ask Copilot:
```
Something is wrong. Please help me understand what happened.
```

## 📝 **Example: Providing Technical Info**

**Shimizu asks**: "Can we support Python 3.13?"

**You create**: `tech-info/python-3.13-support.md`

```markdown
# Python 3.13 Support

**Status**: Yes, we can support it with minor changes.

## Current Situation
- Currently tested: Python 3.8 - 3.12
- Dependencies: All support 3.13

## What Needs to Change
1. Update `pyproject.toml` line 23: `python = "^3.8,<3.14"`
2. Add 3.13 to GitHub Actions testing matrix
3. Test locally (I can do this today)

## Estimated Work
- Time: 2 hours
- Risk: Low

## My Recommendation
We should add this. It's easy and shows we're up-to-date.

---
**Created by**: Takahashi  
**Date**: [Today]
```

Then say to Copilot:
```
I've answered Shimizu's Python 3.13 question
```

---

## 📋 **Example: Reviewing a Draft**

**Shimizu's draft says**: "We will add GPU acceleration support"

**If you think**: "That's too much work for this review"

**You say to Copilot**:
```
This draft promises GPU support, but that's not feasible right now.
Help me suggest a better response.
```

**Copilot will help you** suggest realistic alternatives.
